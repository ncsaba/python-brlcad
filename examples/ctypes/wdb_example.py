"""
This is the python version of wdb_example.c using some ctypes bindings against
BRL-CAD.

wdb_example.c header text:

    Create a BRL-CAD geometry database from C code.

    Note that this is for writing (creating/appending) a database.

    Note that since the values in the database are stored in millimeters, the
    arguments to the mk_* routines are constrained to also be in millimeters.
